trust signals:
you bought from them
    - you already trust them enough to buy from them
    - scale by tez spent, number of purchases
they bought from you
    - if someone buys from you, they probably trust you
    - does this mean we believe they're not a scam project? maybe
    - scale by tez spent, number of purchases
is bought from (amount of tez spent)
    - if people are willing to spend tez, they probably trust the project
    - watch out for / exclude wash trading (might be hard to detect)
    - consider setting a minimum tez spent threshold to filter out low-value transactions
    - especially consider if established artists and collectors are buying (ie trust spreads from known trusted accounts)
buys from other trusted projects
    - if a user has bought from other trusted projects it might indicate a level of genuine interest in the ecosystem/marketplace
    - could be gamed (buy from big projects, flip, post copymints, repeat) but maybe a signal when combined with other factors?
history
    - we will add negative signals in the system (ban lists, reports) to catch out bad actors, so an account with a long history without reports could be a signal of trust (havent been caught yet = maybe theyre legit) and a new account with no history is less trustworthy
external reputation
    - if we can link to external reputation systems (eg social media profiles, web of trust systems) that could help build a trust profile for an account
    - eg tezprofile connected to a valid twitter account with good standing could be a positive signal


untrust signals:
ban list
    - moderators can add accounts to a ban list for various reasons (scamming, spamming, abusive behaviour)
    - being on the ban list is a very strong negative signal
wash/circular trading
    - generally a sign of manipulation
funds from known bad actors
    - if an account has received funds from known bad actors (scammers, hackers) it could indicate a higher risk profile (new account same dickhead)
    - maybe other links to consider as well
    - if an account has sent funds to known bad actors it could also be a negative signal
    - weigh against positive signals (eg a trusted artist has 2 tez sent to them from a scammer trying to troll their rank, shouldnt tank their trust score)
