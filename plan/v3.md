# Teia Decentralized Trust Network

## 1. Executive Summary

A fully on-chain, transparent trust system for Teia that enables decentralized content moderation. Instead of relying on a centralized authority, trust and validity propagate through the network based on **proven collection history** (skin in the game).

**Core Concept:**
Users see signals based on their own network. If you trust Artist A, and Artist A trusts Artist B, then Artist B appears "Trusted" to you. This creates a personalized, ungameable filtering system.

## 2. The "Traffic Light" UX

Instead of a complex numerical score, the frontend displays three distinct states to the user.

### 🟢 Trusted (Green)

* **Meaning:** Validated by your network.
* **Trigger:**
* **Depth 1:** You collected from or vouched for them.
* **Depth 2:** Someone you collected from/vouched for collected from them.


* **Display:** *"Trusted by [Name] and 4 others you follow."*

### 🔴 Blocked (Red)

* **Meaning:** Flagged by a banlist you subscribe to.
* **Trigger:** Account appears on the "Teia Moderation" list (default) or a custom user list (opt-in).
* **Display:** Content blurred. *"Blocked by Teia Moderation."* (Click to reveal).

### 🟡 Unknown (Yellow)

* **Meaning:** No connection found.
* **Trigger:** Not in your Depth-2 network AND not on a banlist.
* **Display:** *"New or unconnected account."*
* **Context:** Displays account age (e.g., *"First transaction: 2 hours ago"*) to help spot burner accounts.

## 3. Architecture & Logic

To prevent conflating "Taste" with "Safety," the system uses a **Dual-Layer Architecture**.

### Layer 1: The Validity Graph (Green Signals)

* **Purpose:** Sybil resistance (verifying active participants).
* **Source:** Implicit history (past collections) and explicit vouches.
* **The "Depth 2" Cap:** Trust only propagates to "Friends of Friends." This prevents computational overload and keeps trust signals relevant.
* *You → Artist A → Artist B (Stop).*



### Layer 2: The Safety Layer (Red Signals)

* **Purpose:** Filtering spam, copymints, and malware.
* **Source:** Opt-in subscription lists.
* **Independence:** Collecting from an artist gives them "Validity" (Green) but does **not** automatically subscribe you to their "Banlist" (Red).
* **Default State:** New users are subscribed to the "Teia Moderation" list by default but can opt-out.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: "The Lens" (Read-Only / MVP)

*Goal: Visualize existing trust networks and filter spam with zero user cost.*

* **Infrastructure:**
* **Indexer:** Scrapes historical Teia/Objkt contracts to build the `User -> Collected -> Creator` graph.
* **Banlist:** Fetches the existing Teia moderation list (GitHub/API).


* **User Action:** None. Users simply log in and see the Traffic Light badges based on their existing collection history.
* **Cost:** 0 Tezos.

### Phase 2: "The Voice" (Active Participation)

*Goal: Allow users to signal trust/distrust explicitly without buying art.*

* **Infrastructure:** Deploy **Trust Registry Smart Contract**.
* **New Features:**
* **Vouch Button:** Turn a Yellow profile Green without spending money (costs gas).
* **Custom Lists:** Subscribe to 3rd party curation/banlists (e.g., "CleanNFT List").


* **Contract Actions:** `vouch()`, `distrust()`, `revoke()`.

## 5. User Onboarding (The Cold Start)

How the system handles a brand new user with no wallet history:

1. **Default Safety:** The user is subscribed to the "Teia Moderation" banlist. No spam is visible.
2. **Default Trust:** Everyone appears **🟡 Unknown**.
3. **Building the Graph:** As soon as the user collects their first NFT, they generate a Depth 1 connection to that artist, and Depth 2 connections to that artist's network. Yellow lights immediately start turning Green.

## 6. Technical Considerations

### Performance & Persistence

* **Indexer Snapshots:** To avoid slow page loads, the indexer pre-calculates the "Depth 2" neighbor list for active users periodically (e.g., every 30 mins).
* **Fail-Safe:** If the Indexer goes offline, the website reverts to **"Raw Mode"**—banlists fail open (or use a local fallback), badges disappear, and the marketplace functions normally without social signals.

### Privacy & Transparency

* **Public Data:** All "Trust" data is derived from public chain actions (collections). Users cannot opt-out of the dataset, but can choose to ignore the signals in their UI.
* **Open Algorithm:** The logic is client-side and open source. No black boxes.

## 7. Key Benefits

* **Sybil Resistance:** Trust must be earned through "Proof of Spend" (collecting) or "Proof of Burn" (gas for vouching).
* **Soft Moderation:** Teia Core Team becomes just another user in the graph. If the community disagrees with Teia's moderation, they can unsubscribe from the list.
* **Scalability:** Indexing is capped at Depth 2, ensuring queries remain fast even as the network grows.
